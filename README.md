Shared, general-purpose quality control functions for AIND data processing pipelines.

`qc-utils` is a central home for quality control logic that is common across
platforms and pipelines. The goal is to maintain QC functions in one place so
that they can be imported by other libraries rather than being re-implemented in
many repositories.

> **Status:** Early development. The library is just getting started and
> contributions are welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get involved.

## Installation
To use the library, in the root directory run
```bash
pip install -e .
```

To set up a development environment, run
```bash
pip install -e . --group dev
```
Note: the `--group` flag is available only in pip versions >=25.1.

Alternatively, if using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), run
```bash
uv sync
```

## Usage
QC functions and examples will be documented here as they are added.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for
testing, linting, and pull request guidelines.
